# node-poolagent

node-poolagent is a socket-pooling
[HTTP agent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) for
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) that keeps sockets open for reuse until a specified timeout.

## Example usage

```javascript
var http = require("http"),
    PoolAgent = require("./poolagent.js").PoolAgent;
    
var poolAgent = new PoolAgent({
      availableTimeout: 5000, // close sockets after they've been idle for 5000ms
      maxSockets: 10 // allow up to 5 concurrent open sockets per host-port pair
    }),
    httpRequestOptions = {
      hostname: "google.com",
      port: 80, path: "/",
      agent: poolAgent
    };

for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  http.get(httpRequestOptions, function (res) {
    // process response
  });
}
```

## TODO
  * add support for HTTPS (implement creation of TLS sockets)
  * distribute as an [npm](https://npmjs.org) package
  * add automated tests
  * test in recent versions of Node.js (last tested in v0.8.14)
  * allow the timeout to be set to zero to close socket immediately after
    response is received (this probably happens to behave as desired currently
    only due to the way that Node happens to handle events)
